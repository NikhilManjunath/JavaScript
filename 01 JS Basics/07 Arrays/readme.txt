Arrays are used to store multiple related pieces of information
Contents of an array are called as Elements
Index in an array starts from 0
Each Element refrenced by their index eg: grade[0] -> 80

Declaring an Array:
  1. var grades = [80, 89, 34, 24, 56]
  2. var fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Mango'];
  3. var images = document.getElementsByClassName['imgs']
  4. var listitems = document.getElementsByTagName['li']


  Elements of an array dont have to be of the same type
  Arrays have attributes and methods
