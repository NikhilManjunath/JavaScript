events -> when functions are executed based on the occurence of a special event

some of the events:
  1. onclick - user clicks on an HTML element

  2. onmouseover - user moves the mouse over an HTML element

  3. onresize - browser window is resized

  4. onload - when a page is loaded

When an event is called, the function must be in quotes (better to use double quotes)
eg: <div onclick = "message('hi')">
